The concerned project is being developed under the program **Learn IT, Girl !** . My project name is **CodeChat** which is being developed under the eye of my mentor [@vishaka](https://github.com/vishakha-lall)

## What is CodeChat all about?

 - CodeChat is used for sending codes like a chat message and makes your code easily shareable to others who have joined the session.  
 - If one user sends the code then, it is available to all other users who are currently active on that particular session.
 - If a new user joins a chat then, all the current members get a flash message of his / her joining the chat.

## Advantages of CodeChat

   It will play an effective role to assist programmers who are remotely located and need to share their code in collaboration
    
-   There is a availability of CHATBOX through which programmers can convey message to other programmers by sending message .
    
-   By providing a feature of sending message to all at once, ,the workload becomes less of the project manager
